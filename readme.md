# ML Algorithms from Scratch ðŸŽ¯

Welcome to **ML Algorithms from Scratch**, a fun and educational project where we implement popular machine learning algorithms without relying on high-level libraries. This repository is all about getting to the core of how these algorithms work, step by step.

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside?
- Implementations of foundational ML algorithms, written from scratch.
- Clear, well-documented code to help you understand the math and logic behind each algorithm.
- Examples to demonstrate how each algorithm performs.

## ðŸ“š Algorithms Included
- Regression (Linear, Logistic)
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical)
- Neural Networks (Simple to Advanced)
- Optimization techniques like Gradient Descent
- And many more to come!

## ðŸŒŸ Why This Project?
- To demystify the "magic" behind machine learning libraries.
- To build a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of ML.
- To have fun coding, learning, and growing!
